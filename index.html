	<h1>Hi there, I'm En Zhou!</h1>
	<p>
		I have been attracted by the magnificent Table Mountain 16 years ago when I set my first step on this magic land. I finished
		both my degrees (Bachelor and Masters in Physics) in UWC and obtained my permanent residence while I was pursuing my PhD
		at UCT. I am passionate about coding in any programming languages, and fascinated on improving algorithms using parallel
		fashion, and applying programmatic solutions to any traditional problems. I am currently employed as a Python developer at
		VOSS. Until now, I have worked with Python for about 4 years. I also programmed in C++ and CUDA API for about 6 years during
		my academic years.
	</p>

	<p>
		I believe as a developer, one should continuously learn new skills, technologies and tools. I spent a large amount of my
		spare time teaching myself front-end skills from freeCodeCamp. To keep up with the trend, I also started to use AWS and bought
		several courses from Udemy. There are some courses I've completed in Codecademy some time ago, such as "Learn the command
		line", "Learn SQL", and "Learn Python". To practise what I learned on the side and from work, I have created some small projects
		on GitHub. You can check them out in my GitHub.
	</p>

	<p>
		With the 4-year experience of working in a Scaled Agile team, the parallel programming background, and some Database skills,
		I'd like to continue work with Python, to be exposed to front-end development and DevOps projects. I'm also fascinated in
		Data Science, it would be great if I can work as a software developer who needs to work with Data Scientists so that I'll
		learn what Data Science is and possibly to be one of them in the near future.
