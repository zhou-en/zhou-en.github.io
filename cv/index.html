			<h2 class = "heading">History and Profile</h2>	
				<p>
					 In VOSS, I have to continuously work on the development of CUCDM as our only product in the past 4 years. I've created user
					interfaces information for non-interactive login response, this is to support our Business Admin Portal feature so that the
					end admin user can select their interface according to their role during login. I enhanced the user role feature by implementing
					access profile validation to avoid creating a user with higher privileges than the admin user. I created login banner API
					endpoint in the back-end code with Python to support a front-end development, so that the correct information of the banner
					can be displayed when a user is logged in. There were numerous data model migration scripts had to be created to maintain
					product upgrades among releases. Some of the bug fixes had to convert to patches so that they can be installed on the live
					systems. While working on bugs or features, I have to create sufficient unit and functional tests to ensure the quality of
					my deliverables. I also have to do L3 support on monthly basis, which means I have to create or come up with a workaround
					for the customer on product systems once get called. This has been increased my product knowledge base enormously since I
					have to work on the live system that not allow making a single mistake.
